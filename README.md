# Multi-Modal Sentiment Analysis

This project performs sentiment classification (positive, neutral, negative) on social media posts using both text and image data.

### 🧠 Techniques Used:
- BERT for NLP (text classification)
- ResNet50 for CV (image classification)
- Feature-level fusion for final sentiment prediction

### 🔍 Structure:
- Text and image data preprocessing
- Separate model training for text and images
- Fusion model combining both modalities
- Evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

Final Fusion Accuracy: **~44.6%**
